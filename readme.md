# fontpath-renderer

[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

A generic renderer for fontpath glyphs. 

**This is a low-level module** and is mostly used internally.

Instead, you are encouraged to use [fontpath-canvas](https://github.com/mattdesl/fontpath-canvas) for 2D canvas, [fontpath-gl](https://github.com/mattdesl/fontpath-gl) for WebGL, or [fontpath-simple-renderer](https://github.com/mattdesl/fontpath-simple-renderer) for render-agnostic custom solutions.
